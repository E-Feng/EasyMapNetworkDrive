# EasyMapNetworkDrive
A GUI to easily map network drive

Lab names stored in excel files for ease of use. Currently mapped letters are checked to ensure a free one is always used. If similar prefix address is currently mapped, transferring files are checked to prevent terminated file transfer. If no transfer is found, the previous mapped drive is removed and the new one mapped.
